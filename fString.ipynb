    "The line f\"MyClass(x={self.x}, y={self.y})\" is an example of an f-string, which is a feature introduced in Python 3.6. F-strings are a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals.\n",

    "{self.y}: Inside these curly braces, the expression self.y is evaluated, and its value is inserted into the string. This is the value of the y attribute of the instance.\n",
    ")\": The closing parenthesis and double quote to complete the string.\n",
