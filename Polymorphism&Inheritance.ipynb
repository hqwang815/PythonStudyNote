    "## Polymorphism With Inheritance\n",
    "Polymorphism is mainly used with inheritance. In inheritance, child class inherits the attributes and methods of a parent class. The existing class is called a base class or parent class, and the new class is called a subclass or child class or derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using method overriding polymorphism allows us to defines methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class. This process of re-implementing the inherited method in the child class is known as **Method Overriding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In polymorphism, Python first checks the object’s class type and executes the appropriate method when we call the method. For example, If you create the Car object, then Python calls the speed() method from a Car class."
